        <p>Hey everyone! (And hello ladies!) I'm Sanji, the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates. </p>
        <p> You know, ONE PIECE Day is coming up - August 10 and 11, 2024! MIT is proud to partner with Y12, the official ONE PIECE support channel. (To be honest, the crew at Y12 love ONE PIECE. And ONLY ONE PIECE. No other Japanese shows would do. It's either ONE PIECE, or nothing at all.) </p>
        <p>That is why we're preparing MEAT ON THE BONE - a classic meal that the future King Of the Pirates, Monkey D. Luffy, enjoys. And that's why I'm takin' over this page.</p>
        <p>You ready to prepare the dish? Here we go!</p>
